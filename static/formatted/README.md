# Formatted TradingView Lightweight Charts

This directory contains formatted versions of the TradingView Lightweight Charts library to make it easier to read and understand.

## Files

1. **prettier-view.html** - An HTML page that loads the original minified JavaScript and displays it in a more readable format with syntax highlighting. Open this file in a web browser to view the formatted code.

2. **lightweight-charts.formatted.js** - A partially formatted version of the JavaScript file. This file contains the beginning of the library with proper formatting, indentation, and comments.

## How to Use

### HTML Viewer
1. Open `prettier-view.html` in your web browser
2. The page will load and format the original minified JavaScript file
3. You can read the code with improved formatting and syntax highlighting

### Formatted JS File
The `lightweight-charts.formatted.js` file contains a manually formatted version of the beginning of the library. This demonstrates how the code would look with proper formatting.

## Note

The original minified file (`../lightweight-charts.standalone.production.js`) is still used by your application. These formatted versions are only for reading and understanding the code better.

If you need to make changes to the library, it's recommended to:
1. Understand the code using these formatted versions
2. Make changes to the original minified file
3. Test thoroughly to ensure your changes work as expected
